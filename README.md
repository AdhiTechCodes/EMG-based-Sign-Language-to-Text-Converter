# EMG-based-Sign-Language-to-Text-Converter
A wearable assistive system that converts sign language gestures into text using EMG and IMU sensors. Muscle activity and hand motion are processed by an STM32 microcontroller to display real-time text output, improving communication for hearing- and speech-impaired users.
